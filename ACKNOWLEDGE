Rayleigh has been developed by Nicholas Featherstone with support by the National Science 
Foundation through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG).  This multi-year
effort was supported by NSF grants NSF-0949446 and NSF-1550901.

We politely ask that you acknowledge the NSF & CIG in any work that uses Rayleigh.  

We also politely request that you cite Rayleigh in any articles, peer-reviewed or otherwise, that EITHER:

(a) present results computed using Rayleigh 

OR

(b) present results computed using third party software that relies on some portion(s) of the Rayleigh source code.

A paper describing the parallelization of Rayleigh and the accuracy of its algorithms is now in preparation. For this version
of the code ONLY (version 0.9.x), please cite BOTH of the following references:
